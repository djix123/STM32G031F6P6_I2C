# STM32G031F6P6_I2C_BMP390

Minimal STM32 HAL example demonstrating connecting to a Bosch BMP390 temperature and pressure sensor (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4816) using the Bosch BMP3 API (https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BMP3-Sensor-API)
<br><br>
Other features: Uses lightweight printf (https://github.com/mpaland/printf) and a hardware timer to provide microsecond delay required by the BMP3 API
